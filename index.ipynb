    "<!-- - The same LD score is used for all pairs of traits.\n",

    "- The method does not provide a causal relationship between two traits. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "A criticism of LD score regression is that every analysis for each pair of traits uses the same LD scores as the dependent variable in the regression model (and as LD scores have been precomputed by its proponents, literally the same LD scores are used in the majority of applied analyses). This means that any influential points in the regression will affect not only one LD score regression analysis, but all such analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "LD scores are also likely to be a ‘weak instrument’ in the language of Mendelian randomization, as they will only explain a small proportion of variance in the dependent variable. Additionally, due to the scale of the data, it is not possible to provide a visual representation of an LD score regression analysis. Standard regres- sion diagnostics are rarely, if ever, performed. Finally, results from LD score regression are not always consistent with known causal relationships; for example, the method did not find evidence for a genetic correlation between LDL cholesterol and CHD risk that survived a multipletesting correction (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015).\n",
